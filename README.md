# 05-Space-shooter
Project made for C220 (a game technology class at Indiana University), this is a space shooter game made with Python code. I followed Jason Francis's tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0480MSwW-zo&feature=youtu.be to get the foundation of the game. I then made my own changes (such as scoring system, balancing bullet damages and times, number of enemies, etc.)
