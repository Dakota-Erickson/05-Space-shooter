Project: P05-Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/Dakota-Erickson/05-Space-Shooter.git 



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that there is a code making enemies attack the player while they are moving around. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would like to apply the code that makes enemies move around and attack the player back to my own programming projects. My Space Shooter project does not have any code that makes enemies move around and shoot the player.  
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I personally do not have suggestions for my peer. The code looks perfectly fine and runs well. Also, there wasn't anything I had to repair.  
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Since my peer made the code well, there was nothing that could have been clearer or better commented. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
There wasn't anything confusing to me in the code. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
The repository contains an appropriate LICENSE. It contains current year and my peer's name. 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
To make the README.md more descriptive, he could have written what changes he exactly made while he was working on the project, such as writing what code he used to make the enemies attack the player.   
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
He did really well. I especially liked the background. I was surprised when the enemies began moving around and attacking me. There were no errors in the code. His LICENSE contained right information (current year and his name). He also wrote a summary of what he did on README.md. In conclusion, his project is great.
